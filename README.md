# klimagrafik-scrollytelling

a basic (works local without the need to build things or even a server) scrolytelling template 

## Getting Started (Basic)

open `01-example/index.html` in your browser. start editing the files in `01-example/` in any code editor to change things.

## Getting Started (Advanced)

this requires some experiece in using a command line as well as having node/npm installed, but it gives the advantage to auto-reload pages when files are changed and enables linting to keep your code nice and tidy.

install packages in the project directory
```
npm i
```

start a server
```
npm run serve
```
